This is a very simple utility to convert a json document to a yaml form.

It makes use of the fact that Json is essentially Yaml, it loads up a json document and then prints it back in a yaml form

To run it:
[source]
----
go build
./json2yaml -j sample.json
----

You start say with :
[source]
----
{
  "akey": "avalue",
  "alist": [
    "one", "two"
  ],
  "anIntegerList":[
    1, 2, 3, 4
  ]
}

----

and end up with:
[source]
----
akey: avalue
alist:
- one
- two
anIntegerList:
- 1
- 2
- 3
- 4
----
